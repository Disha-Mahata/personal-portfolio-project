This project is a fully responsive Personal Portfolio Website created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It serves as my professional online portfolio, showcasing my skills, projects, resume, and contact information in a clean and modern design. The website includes a home section with a brief introduction and profile picture, an about section describing my background and skills, a projects section displaying the work I have completed along with screenshots, and a resume download option. The site also features a dark and light theme toggle, smooth scrolling, and a simple, user-friendly layout that works well on desktop, tablet, and mobile devices. All images and documents used in the portfolio are stored inside the portfolio folder, which includes my profile photo, resume PDF, and page screenshots. The project is hosted on GitHub Pages for easy public access, and the repository contains more than ten commits, showing clear development progress. This portfolio allows visitors to view my work, understand my abilities, and contact me easily. It also fulfills academic requirements such as GitHub hosting, version control usage, and a demonstration video that showcases the website’s features, responsiveness, and repository structure
